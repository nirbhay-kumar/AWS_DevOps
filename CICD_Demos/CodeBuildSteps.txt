Step Prerequisite : Setup a code repo on GitHub with local repo 

Go to GitHub account and create a repository ex.cicd
Create PAT in GitHub account  ex. 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
(Go to settings ---> Developer settings ---> Generate Token( classic ))
Go to local machine and create a folder named cicd
Go inside folder and open GitBash
enter git init command
enter git remote add origin "githuburl"
enter git credentials 
user name : your git account username
pwd: PAT

Copy all source code into local folder
Perform following commands in Gitbash
git status
git add .
git status
git commit -m "first commit"
git push -u origin master

This will setup your GitHub
Now create build project using following steps

Step 1:
go to code build service
create project rajCodeBuildwithGitHub
select source provider as GitHub
You will see error in red color that GitHub is not connected
select the checkbox of Use override credentials for this project only
Click on small link =>create a new personal access token connection.
New windows will appear 
Write some secret name ex. RajPAT
and Enter GitHub personal access token and click on create  ex. ghp_GD8cyPXygwPjLxT274dqWPdssff471pQIHk
click on Manage account credentials. and choose git connection under Personal Access Token and save
(you will see message : Your account is successfully connected through Secrets Manager secret)
select Git hub repository ex. rajproject / enter the complete GitHub url of repository
under source version type as GitHub Branch name

Use following step with * only if you want to send artifact to s3 bucket- in case you build the file
*under Buildspec- choose Use a Buildspec file option
*under Artifacts option -> select artifacts option as Amazon s3
*select the Bucket name you created initially for output artifact purpose
*Under Namespace type- choose Build id
*Under Artifact packaging -choose Zip

Create project

Go to IAM service and open CodeBuild role---> add s3fullaccesspermissions
Now on CodeBuild Project page click on Start build
Observer the status and Build logs
Finally It succeeds
Observe Phase details
Finally check s3 bucket to see artifacts uploaded by build process

Step 2: 
Go to local repo, open index.html and Change the word congratulations in to something different and commit changes. 
Again start build on code build project.
You will observe build fail because of test command resulted in failure.
Got to local repo and recorrect the changes in index.html and repeat all process. This time build will succeed.
