AWS TaskCat Overview

TaskCat stands for Test Automation for CloudFormation Templates.

It is an open-source Python-based tool developed by the AWS Quick Start team.

Purpose

Automatically deploys your CloudFormation templates across multiple AWS regions

Validates templates for errors and misconfigurations

Helps ensure infrastructure works as expected before production deployment

Supports multi-region testing, including nested stacks

Key Features
Feature	Description
Multi-region testing	Deploy a single template in multiple regions automatically
Multi-instance testing	Deploy multiple instances of a template with different parameter sets
Automated reporting	Generates test results including success/failure of each stack
Integration	Can be integrated with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, CodePipeline, Jenkins)
Nested stack support	Supports testing of templates that include nested stacks
Open-source	You can customize it for your own testing scenarios
How TaskCat Works

Define a test configuration in a taskcat.yml file

Specify the template you want to test and the regions/parameters

Run TaskCat → it deploys the stacks in AWS

Monitor deployments → success/failure is reported

Destroy stacks automatically after testing (optional)

Example taskcat.yml
project:
  name: my-cfn-demo
  regions:
    - us-east-1

tests:
  mytest:
    template: template.yaml
    parameters:
      BucketName: taskcat-demo-bucket
      Environment: test


project.name → Name of the test project

regions → AWS regions to test

tests → One or more tests with parameters

template → Path to CloudFormation template

template.yaml

Parameters:
  BucketName:
    Type: String
    Description: Name of the S3 bucket to create

Resources:
  DemoBucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: !Ref BucketName


Running TaskCat
